<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* I have an e-commerce site built on wordpress. The issue is that I need to recreate it from scratch in React.
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* Create the general layout of the store page.
* Create Product template that contains the various aspects of a product (name, price, tag, SKU, image, amount in inventory)
* Create a shopping cart.
* Add functionality to add a product to the cart, which decreases amount in inventory.
* Add functionality to remove an item from the shopping cart.
* Add functionality for searching among all products.
*
*
*
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* Added pages for home, cart, and page not found.
* Created products.json to house the products and their properties.
* Added custom fonts to mimic the site built on wordpress.
